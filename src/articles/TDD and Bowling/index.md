# TDD and the Bowling Game Kata - Introduction

Welcome to a series of articles that use a technique to learn Test Driven Development (TDD).  Not just learn, but develop the skill-set through practice and repetition.

The technique is called **code kata** in which you learn by doing.  On this page we will start by talking about TDD, how it works and its benefits.  We will briefly look at the idea of code kata and one kata in particular: the bowling game kata.

Then over the next five pages we will go through the steps of the kata in detail, emerging on the other side with a working bowling game scoring class and a full suite of tests, all developed using TDD.

In total there are six pages:

* TDD and the Bowling Game Kata - Introduction **(you are here)**
* Test #1 - Gutter game scores zero
* Test #2 - All Ones scores 20
* Test #3 - One Spare followed by one scoring roll, then all zeros
* Test #4 - One Strike followed by two scoring rolls, then all zeros
* Test #5 - A perfect game (12 strikes) scores 300

## What is a test?

In the context of this introduction, it is important to understand what a developer does compared to what QA does.  Both "test", but that word is doing double duty.



## Test Driven Development

TDD is a software development discipline.
