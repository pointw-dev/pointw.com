# Pronunciation and the metric system - a millirant

The metric system - what a proud achievement of the human race. Elegance, consistency, utility. If your country hasn't
adopted it as its measurement standard, what are you waiting for?

There is one minor problem, though, that I would like to address. It's not with the system itself, but with a popular
pronunciation of just one word.

## KIL-oh-mee-ter

The word is *kilometre*. The correct pronunciation is "KIL-oh-mee-ter".

Look at some of the other prefixes in front of -metre:

- millimeter - MIL-i-mee-ter  (not mil-I-mi-ter)
- centimeter - CENT-i-mee-ter (not cen-TI-mi-ter)

Why then do so many people say "kil-AW-mi-ter"?

## How did this happen?

Canada started using the metric system in the early 70s. I remember the strange updates to road signs, and the new
textbooks emblazoned with this logo:

The adjustment wasn’t easy. Was it just me, or did everything in metric seem smaller at first? A mile is bigger than a
kilometre. A centimeter is smaller than an inch. When it was 80° F outside, it was only 27° C. Sure, a kilogram is
bigger than a pound, but stores sell many things by the pitiful gram (two slices of tomato are 40g - how can anyone life
that sandwich?). Depending on your age and where you live (esp. whether you live near the US border), there may still be
some old units you are more comfortable with. Even today, I don’t know my own height in centimetres – I’m 5'8" dammit.

But everyone gets the kilometre. From car dashboards to roadsigns, the kilometre is everywhere. So why is the most
successful of the metric units the one that is most mispronounced? I blame this guy:

This device follows a familiar pattern for naming measuring devices.

- Thermometer: a device that measures thermal heat
- Speedometer: a device that measures speed
- Altimeter: a device that measures altitude
- Barometer: a device that measures air pressure

The pattern is:

- Make a prefix of the thing you are measuring
- put the accent on final vowel
- if that vowel is an O make it rhyme with AW
- tack on the “-mi-ter” part.

The word kilometre appears to fit this pattern. But a kilometre is not a measuring device. The prefix *kilo* does end
with the letter O, but it ends with *metre*, not *meter*. The “thermometer pattern” doesn’t apply.

## Consistency

The beauty of the metric system is its consistency. You may know how many ounces are in a pound, but it doesn’t help if
you need to know how many feet are in a mile. Because of the consistency of the metric system, even if you do not know
what a joule is, you know there are a thousand of them in a kilojoule.

Do you apply the “thermometer pattern” to any other prefixed metric units?

- kilogram: Do you pronounce it “kil-AW-grum”?
- kilopascal: Should the forecast say “the pressure today is 101.7 “kil-AW-pass-kulls”?
- gigawatt: Does Doc Brown lament the difficulty in generating “1.21 jig-AW-wuts”?

> I hear you asking: What about the “one point twenty-one” part, or the “jiga”? – that’s for another rant!

No? Then for the sake of consistency please pronounce it “KIL-oh-mee-ter”. It is awkward at first, yes – but you will get used
to it. Kinda like the metric system itself.

There. I feel better.
