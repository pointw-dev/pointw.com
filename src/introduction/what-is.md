# What is pointw.com?

My name is Michael Ottoson.  I have remade `pointw.com` to share my experience as a software development professional.

## Why am I here?
My goal is to deliver software solutions to businesses by understanding business requirements then delivering tools people love to use.

I accomplish this by

* following best practices including BDD so that when a test passes we are not merely checking a todo box, but are
  assured that users are receiving value,
* creating toolkits that allow the development team to get something quickly for review in front of users and
  stakeholders, creating a tight feedback loop so we stay laser focused on what is required,
* sharing the benefit of my experience, and learning from the experiences of others, to avoid the "I have a hammer so
  everything looks like a nail", rather we are always engaged in a life-long dialog where everyone grows together.

## What's in a name?

I registered `pointw.com` in the mid-90s.  At that time the internet was new to most people.  It was often called "the information superhighway".

On a regular highway we go from point A to point B.  On the **W**eb, there is no distance between any two points.  

**There is no "point A to point B" - there is only point W.**

It seemed like a good name at the time.  However, it does make it difficult to tell people my email address.

> Someone: `michael@.w.com`?
