# What is pointw?

We are a brand-new, up and coming company. Our goal is to deliver software solutions to businesses by understanding
business requirements then delivering tools people love to use.

We accomplish this by

* creating toolkits that allow the development team to get something quickly for review in front of users and
  stakeholders, creating a tight feedback loop so we stay laser focused on what is required,
* following best practices including BDD so that when a test passes we are not merely checking a todo box, but are
  assured that users are receiving value,
* sharing the benefit of our experience, and learning from the experiences of others, to avoid the "we have a hammer so
  everything looks like a nail", rather we are always engaged in a life-long dialog where everyone grows together.

This site is under development as we are on the verge of releasing our first major set of products.

Please stay tuned!
