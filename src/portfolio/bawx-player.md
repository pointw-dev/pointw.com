# bawx-player

> This is a port of Kelvin Lawson's [pykaraoke library](https://github.com/kelvinlawson/pykaraoke) (upgraded from Python 2 to Python 3 and packaged)

<portfolio-repos name="bawx-player" github pypi />

I built a juke box / karaoke system called `juke-bawx` for use in bars, restaurants, weddings, etc. (similar to [TouchTunes](https://www.touchtunes.com/) but with karaoke as well)

I found an open source library that plays karaoke CDG files, but it was out of date (Python 2.7).  So I cloned, upgraded, and put this library into a pypi package.
