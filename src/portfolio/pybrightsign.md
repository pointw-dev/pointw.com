# pybrightsign

> BrightSign APIs for humans.  Python module to simplify using the BrightSign BSN/BSNEE&nbsp;[REST API](https://docs.brightsign.biz/display/DOC/REST+API).

<portfolio-repos name="pybrightsign" github pypi />

This library handles many of the fussy details when integrating your client with the BrightSign APIs (esp. the Upload API).  This frees the developer from much boilerplate code.  It also abstracts the breaking changes between the BSNEE's API versions making upgrading to later versions seamless (if only they used [hypermea](https://pointw-dev.github.io/hypermea/) :-) ).
